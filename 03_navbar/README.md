# Navbar in React with Routing

I followed along [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) on YouTube to learn how to deal with Navigation in React with Routing. It's just basic project for the sake of understanding how React Router works.

Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
